Project Procedure: Serverless Email Marketing Application

Step 1: Set Up Amazon SES
- Go to the Amazon SES console.
- Verify your sender email address or domain in the SES region.
- (Optional) Request AWS to move your SES account out of the sandbox.
- Create an email template for your campaign content.

Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket (for Frontend or Email CSV Upload)
- Open the S3 console and create a new bucket.
- Enable static website hosting if you want to host a frontend form.
- (Optional) Upload a CSV file containing email addresses.
- Set appropriate permissions based on usage.

Step 3: Create IAM Role and Permissions
- Go to IAM > Roles and create a new role for AWS Lambda.
- Attach necessary policies:
  - AmazonSESFullAccess (or a limited version)
  - AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess (if reading from S3)
  - AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole (for CloudWatch logging)
- Name the role appropriately (e.g., LambdaEmailRole).

Step 4: Create Lambda Function
- Open the Lambda console and create a new function.
- Choose your preferred runtime (Python, Node.js, etc.).
- Assign the IAM role created earlier.
- Implement logic to read email input and send using SES.

Step 5: Set Up API Gateway (If Using a Web Form)
- Go to API Gateway and create a REST API.
- Create a POST endpoint (e.g., /subscribe).
- Link it to your Lambda function.
- Enable CORS if needed.
- Deploy the API and save the endpoint URL.

Step 6: Create EventBridge Rule (for Scheduled Campaigns)
- Go to Amazon EventBridge.
- Create a new rule (e.g., DailyCampaignTrigger).
- Set a schedule (e.g., every day at 10 AM).
- Set your Lambda function as the target.
- Test the rule to verify it triggers Lambda correctly.

Step 7: (Optional) Host Web Form on S3
- Upload your HTML/CSS/JS files to the S3 bucket.
- Point your form to your API Gateway endpoint.
- Enable static website hosting and permissions.

Step 8: Test Everything
- Trigger email manually or via API/CSV/EventBridge.
- Check logs in CloudWatch for errors or delivery confirmations.
- Verify the email is received correctly.

Step 9: Monitor and Maintain
- Use CloudWatch Logs to monitor Lambda executions.
- Set up SNS notifications in SES for bounces or complaints.
- Adjust IAM permissions and SES limits as needed.
